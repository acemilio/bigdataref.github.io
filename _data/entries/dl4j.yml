description: |
    Deeplearning4j is the first commercial-grade, open-source, distributed deep-learning library written 
    for Java and Scala. Integrated with Hadoop and Spark, DL4J is designed to be used in business environments, 
    rather than as a research tool. It aims to be cutting-edge plug and play, more convention than configuration, 
    which allows for fast prototyping for non-researchers.
