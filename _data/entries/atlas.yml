description: |
    Atlas was developed by Netflix to manage dimensional time series data for near 
    real-time operational insight. Atlas features in-memory data storage, allowing 
    it to gather and report very large numbers of metrics, very quickly.
    Atlas captures operational intelligence. Whereas business intelligence is data 
    gathered for the purpose of analyzing trends over time, operational intelligence 
    provides a picture of what is currently happening within a system.
    Atlas was built because the existing systems Netflix was using for operational 
    intelligence were not able to cope with the increase in metrics we were seeing as 
    we expanded our operations in the cloud. In 2011, we were monitoring 2 million 
    metrics related to our streaming systems. By 2014, we were at 1.2 billion metrics 
    and the numbers continue to rise. Atlas is designed to handle this large quantity 
    of data and can scale with the hardware we use to analyze and store it.
