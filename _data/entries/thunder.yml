description: |
    Thunder is a library for analyzing large-scale spatial and temporal neural data. 
    It's fast to run, easy to extend, and designed for interactivity. It is built on Spark, 
    a new framework for cluster computing.
    Thunder includes utilities for loading and saving different formats, classes for working 
    with distributed spatial and temporal data, and modular functions for time series analysis, 
    factorization, and model fitting. Analyses can easily be scripted or combined. It is written 
    against Spark's Python API (Pyspark), making use of scipy, numpy, and scikit-learn.
