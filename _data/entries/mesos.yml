description: |
    Apache Mesos abstracts CPU, memory, storage, and other compute resources away from machines (physical or virtual),
    enabling fault-tolerant and elastic distributed systems to easily be built and run effectively. Mesos is built using the same principles as the Linux kernel,
    only at a different level of abstraction. The Mesos kernel runs on every machine and provides applications (e.g., Hadoop, Spark, Kafka, Elastic Search) with APIâ€™s
    for resource management and scheduling across entire datacenter and cloud environments.
