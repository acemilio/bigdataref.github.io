    Spindle is a prototype Spark-based web analytics query engine designed around 
    the requirements of production workloads. Spindle exposes query requests through 
    a multi-threaded HTTP interface implemented with Spray. Queries are processed by 
    loading data from Apache Parquet columnar storage format on the Hadoop distributed filesystem.
