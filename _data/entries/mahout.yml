        The Apache Mahout project's goal is to build a scalable machine learning library.
        Scalable to large data sets. Our core algorithms for clustering, classfication and collaborative filtering are implemented on top of scalable, distributed systems. However, contributions that run on a single machine are welcome as well.
        Scalable to support your business case. Mahout is distributed under a commercially friendly Apache Software license.
        Scalable community. The goal of Mahout is to build a vibrant, responsive, diverse community to facilitate discussions not only on the project itself but also on potential use cases. Come to the mailing lists to find out more.
        Currently Mahout supports mainly three use cases: Recommendation mining takes users' behavior and from that tries to find items users might like. Clustering takes e.g.
        text documents and groups them into groups of topically related documents. Classification learns from exisiting categorized documents what documents of a specific category
        look like and is able to assign unlabelled documents to the (hopefully) correct category.
