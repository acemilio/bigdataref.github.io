description: |
    InfluxDB is a time series, metrics, and analytics database. It’s written in Go and has no external dependencies. 
    That means once you install it there’s nothing else to manage (like Redis, ZooKeeper, HBase, or whatever). 
    InfluxDB is targeted at use cases for DevOps, metrics, sensor data, and real-time analytics. 
    It arose from our need for a database like this on more than a few previous products we’ve built.
