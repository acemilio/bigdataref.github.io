name: Pig
description: Apache Pig is a platform for analyzing large data sets that consists of a high-level language for
expressing data analysis programs, coupled with infrastructure for evaluating these programs. The salient property of
 Pig programs is that their structure is amenable to substantial parallelization, which in turns enables them to
 handle very large data sets. At the present time, Pig's infrastructure layer consists of a compiler that produces
 sequences of Map-Reduce programs, for which large-scale parallel implementations already exist (e.g., the Hadoop
 subproject). Pig language layer currently consists of a textual language called Pig Latin, which has the following
 key properties: Ease of programming, optimization opportunities, Extensibility.
