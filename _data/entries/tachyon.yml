name: Tachyon
description: Tachyon is a memory-centric distributed file system enabling reliable file sharing at memory-speed across cluster frameworks, such as Spark and MapReduce. It achieves high performance by leveraging lineage information and using memory aggressively. Tachyon caches working set files in memory, thereby avoiding going to disk to load datasets that are frequently read. This enables different jobs/queries and frameworks to access cached files at memory speed. Tachyon is Hadoop compatible. Existing Spark and MapReduce programs can run on top of it without any code change. The project is open source (Apache License 2.0) and is deployed at multiple companies. It has more than 40 contributors from over 15 institutions, including Yahoo, Intel, and Redhat. The project is the storage layer of the Berkeley Data Analytics Stack (BDAS) and also part of the Fedora distribution.
