    The purpose of a data cube is to store aggregate information about large numbers of data points. 
    The data cube stores aggregate information about interesting subsets of the input data points. 
    For example, if you're writing a web server log analyzer, your input points could be log lines, 
    and you might be interested in keeping a count for each browser type, 
    each browser version, OS type, OS version, and other attributes. You might also be interested in counts 
    for a particular combination of (browserType,browserVersion,osType), 
    (browserType,browserVersion,osType,osVersion), etc. It's a challenge to quickly add and change counters without 
    wasting time writing database code and reprocessing old data into new counters. 
    A data cube helps you keep these counts. You declare what you want to count, 
    and the data cube maintains all the counters as you supply new data points.
