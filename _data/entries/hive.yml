description: |
    The Apache Hive data warehouse software facilitates querying and managing large datasets residing in
    distributed storage. Hive provides a mechanism to project structure onto this data and query the data using a
    SQL-like language called HiveQL. At the same time this language also allows traditional map/reduce programmers to
    plug in their custom mappers and reducers when it is inconvenient or inefficient to express this logic in HiveQL.
